This coronavirus outbreak was first documented in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. These were caused by a new type of coronavirus, and the disease is now commonly referred to as COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unavoidable topic for several months. The number of COVID-19 cases started to escalate more quickly in mid-January, and the virus soon spread beyond China‚Äôs broad. As of writing this, it has now been confirmed on six continents and in more than 100 countries. As a business analytics student, I will try my best to approach the recent COVID-19 pandemic from a data perspective. Therefore, I create a dashboard to track and visualize the spread of COVID-19. You can find the R Shiny dashboard I created here.\nBrief Introduction üì∏ This coronavirus shiny app provides an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. Since only look at the data, it is hard to interpret how fast is the virus spreading, and how does the situation in each country. Then, I created this dashboard to track and visualize the spread by providing several interactive plots and tables, including the timeline function and the ability to overlay past outbreaks. By looking through this dashboard, I hope it is possible to get a deeper understanding of this pandemic.\n Self Review What I did well? üòï This shiny app contains the interactive leaflet map, plots and the summarize table to track and visualize the spread of COVID-19. The dashboard is segmented into several sections that can be selected on the left side of the browser window. I will briefly talk about what I did well regarding this dashboard for each section.\n Map and table    Figure 1: COVID-19 Dashboard ‚Äî Overview Map Section   This map section (Refer to Figure 1) of the dashboard shows the world map and a list of countries with their respective number of confirmed, recovered and death cases. A time-lapse feature with a simple slider is included to get an idea on about the development of the pandemic. The start bottom at the lower right corner of the slider could help users in overview the dynamic changes. Within the leaflet map, I add a label of each point to the map to quickly determine the location for each country. Users could also choose the different types of data in the map by clicking the checkbox, which contains confirmed, recovered and deaths.\n Graph\n  Figure 2: COVID-19 Dashboard ‚Äî Overview Graph Section   This graph section (Figure 2) contains plots visualizing several interesting aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic progression with a brief explanation. In the left graph, users have the ability to manually select the countries and different type of variables such as confirmed, deaths, recovered she or he interested in. The second graph on the right shows the global evolution of cases from 2020-01-22 to 2020-10-07. I add active cases to measure worldwide COVID-19. Active cases could remove deaths and recoveries from daily new cases. This plot has a checkbox with which the y-axis can be switched to a logarithmic scale.\nBoth two graphs have transferred to plotly, which makes it easy to create interactive data visualization.\n About\nThe dashboard is rounded off with the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section, which briefly describes the motivation, data sources and additional information on the creator, which gives users a brief background of this shiny app.\n   What can I improve on? üòµ  In the map section, a separate tab called province and state could add in the table beside the country. To better understanding, refer to Figure 3. Also, connect the table with the timeline.    Figure 3: Improve in Adding Tab    It may be more logical to swap the positions of the left and right graphs because we will review the global situation first, then observe the situation of each country.\n The graph on the left needs to add one variable within the existing three metrics called active, which could be consistent with the variables on the right. Active cases could remove deaths and recoveries from daily new cases. It measures the daily epidemic situation more accurately.\n Since the overall inspiration comes from the John Hopkins Dashboard, adding an acknowledgement part in the about section is necessary. It is courteous and ethical to let readers know that this dashboard had writing help and cooperation with other scholars in the development of my work.\n   Some things I‚Äôd like to add that is plausible ü§®  The input data for this dashboard is from the R package; so far, the data is constantly updated. It will be more readable to add the link to read. As a result, daily cases can be updated directly.  read.csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv\u0026quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)  By looking through other shiny app dashboards, adding several value boxes involves the amount of confirmed, recovered, death and active cases in a day could make data communication with users.   Some things I‚Äôd like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology ü§ï  In the map section, all the coloured circles stand for countries is illogical. The format I want to display is some coloured circles stand for countries and some stand for provinces or states.\nFor example, you could expand the map, then move your mouse to these coloured circles in Australia and read the title in the label. At the bottom side of Australia, that circle should be Victoria instead of Australia (Refer to Figure 4).\n  Figure 4: Problems in Map Section   This issue comes from the data processing steps, in the raw data, some countries have the number of cases both in the whole country and each state while others only have the number of causes related to that country. However, continue to do in-depth data processing to separate state and countries is a challenging work for me.\n Although I connect the slider bar with the map and table, combining the DT table with the map is not in my ability. In my imagination, if I click one of the rows in DT table, the map will locate to that row I click directly no matter that row stands for countries or states.\n    Conclusion Overall, there are several areas I could improve on. Therefore, we create this shiny dashboard into an open-source version, and I could get feedback quickly. I appreciate all of you to contribute to this project with additional visualizations, information etc. If you find any bug/issue or have an idea on how to improve the dashboard, please create an issue on GitHub. I will try to look into it as soon as possible. From my dashboard, if it could help you to improve your skills and learn new things, it would be my pleasure.\n Acknowledgements One package used in this post is knitr (Xie 2014).\nThanks for {coronavirus} package üì¶ provided data (RamiKrispin 2020) and John Hopkins University Dashboard provide ideas for this shiny app (University 2020)\n References RamiKrispin. 2020. ‚ÄúCoronavirus.‚Äù GitHub Repository. https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus; GitHub.\n University, John Hopkins. 2020. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (Csse) at Johns Hopkins University (Jhu).‚Äù https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.\n Xie, Yihui. 2014. ‚ÄúKnitr: A Comprehensive Tool for Reproducible Research in R.‚Äù In Implementing Reproducible Computational Research, edited by Victoria Stodden, Friedrich Leisch, and Roger D.

Until 13 Sep 2020, there are about 566,326 confirmed cases and 29,747 deaths WHO(Organization 2020).\n Data Source and Descriptions üö® The data is taken from the tidycovid19(Gassen 2020a) package üì¶ created by Joachim Gassen. The tidycovid19 package was created to provide transparent access to various data sources. Then, used download_merged_data to merge the dataset. This merged dataset contains data of coronavirus confirmed, recovered, death original collected from Johns Hopkins University(University 2020). Some other variables contain the frequency places are visited from Google Community Mobility Reports(Google 2020). The second set of data comes from Bing(Bing 2020), which contains all the regions location and cases in Spain. The raw data was stored in two CSV files separately. The data collection date for this blog until 13 Sep 2020. The following map and plots present these variables in the data set and also contain descriptions.\n Is data reflect the real situation? What caused the Coronavirus crisis in Spain? üó∫ Coronavirus crisis is one of the darkest and dramatic moments in recent Spanish history which the virus is spreading faster than any neighboring nation. From Figure 1 below, Madrid, the Spanish region with the highest number of cases, had the confirmed cases of 81,047 in total. After that, Catalonia became the second highest number of cases up to 62,524 until 13 Sep 2020.\n  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/Spain_COVID19/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_map.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 1: Total Confirmed Cases in Each Region  However, this set of number does not show the full picture of Spain‚Äôs coronavirus crisis. Figure 2 does not present daily new cases for all regions; otherwise the plot will be extremely complex and hard to read. Cases for most days is zero or not available. Therefore, how the coronavirus outbreak is developing through the data is not accurate. ELPAIS(ELTAIS 2020) explain the potential reason for this situation. To be specific, the hospital üè• may spend more than one week to process person contracting the disease, some symptoms present and ask for a test and getting the results. In this one-week period, this person did not get isolation and may have local transmission of the coronavirus began to increase. That‚Äôs why experts believe that the number of confirmed cases may be 10 times higher than what they have been reported.\n  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/Spain_COVID19/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_line.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 2: Time serious of daily new cases in each region  What‚Äôs more, what caused the coronavirus in Spain to be a crisis? Guardian(Guardian 2020) gives two fundamental reasons.\n Mundane: The main reason for the quick spread through Spain may be mundane. Hugging, kissing and animated chatter from other‚Äôs face in a few inches have become a commonplace thing. Government: Another reason was the government reacted late ,and clumsily.  Since the financial crisis, Spain has been extremely fragile and this country lacks essential equipment. During the crisis, protective clothing for doctors and coronavirus tests were still only just being sourced ,and China provided assistance within its capability to help Spain Xinhua(Xinhua 2020).\nDue to continued coronavirus deterioration, the lockdown that began on 14 Mar 2020 enforced with police and popular pressure Guardian(Guardian 2020). The next following section will explore lockdown restriction on citizen daily activity frequency changes.\n How lockdown restriction impact citizen daily activity? üë£ Countries around the world are in uncharted territory. The emergence and spread of COVID-19 have touched every facet of society. The Spain nationwide lockdown began at 14 Mar 2020, as a result, daily life comes to a halt, such as public gathering party are cancelled, employees were sent back to home. All sizes of business are facing many uncertainties about their prospects.\nThe following Figure 3 and Figure 4 presents the changes in different activities regarding the lockdown restrictionsüîí. Up to now, stage four restrictions happened twice since the beginning of lockdown at March 14. Stage four was an advanced phase, in which the restriction was limited. More than 23,000 people have died in Spain after contracting coronavirus, making the country one of the worst affected in the world by the illness. At this period, thousands of employee were forced to work at home during nearly three-month coronavirus lockdown. Therefore, people visited workplaces has dropped about 50% compared with before. After the fourth stage lockdown restriction ended, employees allowed to work in the physical workplace and frequency that people visit workplaces increased, but still lower than the average rate. Remote working caused by coronavirus has made many people aware of the convenience. Besides, Spain government are protecting the rights of remote workers. Such as distance working must be a voluntary choice ,or employees have the right to apply compensation for any direct or indirect costs related to remote work ELPAIS(ELPAIS 2020).\n Figure 3: The frequency that people visit workplaces and residential relative to the baseline period Jan 3 - Feb 6, 2020.  Within the lockdown period, parks closed. Most of them transfer the outdoor sports to exercise at home. In Figure 4, people rarely visit parks during the lockdown period. At the end of April, it has seen a steadily declining number of cases per day, leading to the country‚Äôs plan to broaden lockdown restrictions. Spain has released an exit strategy from the lockdown restriction in a bid to return the normality, while keeping COVID-19 under control euronews(euronews 2020). With the gradual relaxation of the lockdown restriction, retail and recreation industry allowed to reopen to the public, such as sidewalk caf√© reopened and Spaniards can exercise outdoors CNN(Goodman 2020). As a consequence, the frequency that people visit parks increase over than 50%, which is higher than any other activities.\n Figure 4: The frequency changes that people visit pharmacy, parks, retail and recreation relative to the baseline period Jan 3 - Feb 6, 2020  Overall, as the pandemic is under control, people‚Äôs travel frequency has increased, especially for outdoor activities. For now, Spain has decreased to the first level of lockdown, daily life gradually returns to normal. However, face masks are now obligatory at ALL times and keep two meters social distance. Some regions such as Aragon Madrid and Catalu√±a are currently experiencing outbreaks that have brought back lockdown in some towns and areas. The government is also making regulations based on the current situation.\n Acknowledgements The packages used for producing this post are:\ntidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), knitr (Xie 2014), kableExtra (Zhu 2019), dplyr (Wickham et al. 2020), tidycovid19(Gassen 2020b), zoo(Zeileis and Grothendieck 2005), ggplot(Wickham 2016),scales(Wickham and Seidel 2020), highcharter(Kunst 2020), leaflet(Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2019), lubridate(Grolemund and Wickham 2011).\nThe raw data comes from two github repositories: tidycovid19(Gassen 2020a) and Bing(Bing 2020).\n References Bing. 2020. ‚ÄúBing Covid-19 Data.‚Äù GitHub Repository. https://github.com/microsoft/Bing-COVID-19-Data; GitHub.\n Cheng, Joe, Bhaskar Karambelkar, and Yihui Xie. 2019.

The situation around the world still serious, and Canada is one of them. The virus was confirmed to spread Canada on January 25, 2020, after a citizen who had traveled ‚úàÔ∏è from Wuhan, Hubei to Toronto, tested positive. With government policies, such as restricting people‚Äôs travel and maintaining social distancing, the cases have declined significantly.\n Data Source and Description üéØ The dataset used in this post is from Isha Berry personal GitHub(Berry I 2020) and the data source is Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ).\nThe COVID-19 data regarding Canada was collected by COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group on confirmed and positive cases. Each line in the dataset represents a unique cases. The original dataset also include information such as age, sex, history travel. The cases, death, recovered dataset were created since the first relevant event occurred. The raw data was stored in seven CSV files separately. The data collection date for this blog until August 27, 2020. The following tables and plots present these variables in the data set and also contain descriptions.\n Each Province COVID-19 Details üîç This interactive datatable concentrate on number of cumulative confirmed cases, daily new cases, cumulative deaths, daily new deaths and the number of recovered in each province and the whole Canada.\n {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/Canada_COVID19/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_DT-table.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  Numercial Summary Statistics üìÑ Table 1 shows that numerical summary statistics of four variables: daily new cases, cumulative cases, daily new deaths and cumulative deaths. In the Max column, the max of daily new cases and daily new deaths represent the maximum value in a day since the COVID-19 spread to Canada, while the max of cumulative cases and cumulative deaths shows the latest results. At the end of the table, cases and deaths in Canada were declined significantly üìâ.\nStories behind the Data: Although cases and deaths in Canada was declined obviously, the authenticity of the data is not accurate. Indigenous Canadians as the indigenous people within the boundaries of the Canada. Indigenous people in Canada take 4.9% of the whole national population. Regarding the CBC news, Indigenous Services Canada releases cumulative number of positive cases, but no data on deaths, recoveries regarding the news from CBC(CBC 2020). As a result, the histogram at the end of the Table 1 does not present a full picture of the indigenous communities. Besides, indigenous communities received inequitable measures from federal government. As of June 25, Canada‚Äôs specific measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in First Nations communities in Canada represent less than one per cent of the federal government‚Äôs funding to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 The Conversation(Conversation 2020).\nTable 1: Numerical Summary Statistics in Canada    Variable  Mean  Min  Q1  Q2  Q3  Max  Hist      cases  773.80723  84  343.75  617.5  1196.75  2560  ‚ñá‚ñÉ‚ñÉ‚ñÇ‚ñÅ    cumulative_cases  79281.09036  341  46659.75  96145.5  111333.00  128709  ‚ñÉ‚ñÇ‚ñÇ‚ñÖ‚ñá    deaths  52.82081  0  6.00  22.0  96.00  229  ‚ñá‚ñÇ‚ñÇ‚ñÇ‚ñÅ    cumulative_deaths  5661.34104  1  1757.00  7456.0  8848.00  9138  ‚ñÉ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÇ‚ñá       Explore the Relationship between Testing and Cases üìà Only for personal interest ü§®, I want to explore the relationship between cases and testing. Since the first cases arrived in Canada in January 25, 2020, the government started to test from March 8, 2020. Therefore, I combine the testing data and cases data together and select all data from March 8 until now. In my personal prediction, with the development of testing, there will be more confirmed cases. In other words, these two variables have the positive relationship. However, from this combination graph, it could not find the relationship between cases and testing in Fig1. In addition, R-squared is 0.188 which is close to 0. Also represents if the cases and testing is linear regression, all the real data is far away from the line. The results regarding R-squared is show in Table 2. The reason they are not related may be that Canada has almost controlled the worsening of the COVID-19 in this period.\n Figure 1: Relationship between testing and cases   Table 2: Summary of the relationship between testing and cases    r.squared  adj.r.squared  statistic  p.value  AIC  BIC      0.1887101  0.1837632  38.14722  0  2520.831  2530.167      Acknowledgements The packages used for producing this post are:\ntidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), broom (Robinson, Hayes, and Couch 2020), skimr (Waring et al. 2020), DT (Xie, Cheng, and Tan 2020), knitr (Xie 2014), kableExtra (Zhu 2019), dplyr (Wickham et al. 2020), lubridate(Grolemund and Wickham 2011).\nTwo news comes from: CBC(CBC 2020), The Conversation(Conversation 2020)\nThe raw data comes from Canada(Berry I 2020)\n References Berry I, Tuite A, Soucy J-PR. 2020. ‚ÄúCovid19Canada.‚Äù GitHub Repository. https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada; GitHub.\n CBC. 2020. ‚ÄúData Gaps Exist on Covid-19 Cases in Indigenous Communities, Says Research Fellow.‚Äù https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/coronavirus-indigenous-data-gap-1.5556676.\n Conversation, The. 2020. ‚ÄúIndigenous Communities at Increased Risk During the Coronavirus Pandemic.‚Äù https://theconversation.com/indigenous-communities-at-increased-risk-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-142027.\n Grolemund, Garrett, and Hadley Wickham. 2011. ‚ÄúDates and Times Made Easy with lubridate.‚Äù Journal of Statistical Software 40 (3): 1‚Äì25. http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i03/.\n Robinson, David, Alex Hayes, and Simon Couch. 2020.
